# Securing Medical Record Using Blockchain Technology
# Project Overview
A blockchain-based medical record system built using Flask and Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet). It ensures medical data integrity through cryptographic hashing and decentralized storage.
# Aim
To create a tamper-proof and secure system for managing medical records using blockchain technology.
# Working
- User uploads a medical file.

- SHA-256 hash of the file is generated.

- The hash is stored on Ethereum via a smart contract.

- MetaMask confirms the transaction.

- Records can be verified anytime using the wallet address.
 # Technologies
Flask • Python • Web3.py • Solidity • Ethereum • MetaMask • SHA-256
# Outcome
A decentralized, transparent, and secure medical record verification system that prevents unauthorized modification.
